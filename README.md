# PREDICTING USER'S MENTAL HEALTH BASED ON SOCIAL MEDIA USAGE.

the dataset utilized for this project can be accessed at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/souvikahmed071/social-media-and-mental-health

## Overview  
This project applies **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** to predict **mental health risks** based on **social media usage patterns**. By analyzing survey responses, the model identifies correlations between online behavior and mental well-being indicators.  

## Features  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends in social media behavior.  
- **Feature Engineering** to derive meaningful metrics like platform engagement and impact scores.  
- **ANN Model Training** using **TensorFlow/Keras**, optimized with **dropout, regularization, and early stopping**.  
- **Performance Evaluation** based on **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras)  
- **Deep Learning** (Artificial Neural Networks)  
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)  

## How to Run  
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
